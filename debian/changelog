lensfun (0.3.2-1) experimental; urgency=medium

  * Team upload.
  * New upstream release (Closes: #771838) (LP: #1455216)
  * Rename liblensfun0 to liblensfun1 according to the new upstream SONAME.
  * Delete the build_docs.diff patch, it was not applied in previous versions
    already.
  * Rename liblensfun-data to liblensfun-data-v1, following upstream's
    indications about the separate versioning of the lensfun database.
  * Update .install files.
  * Mark liblensfun1 as "Multi-Arch: same".
  * Replace the python build dependency with python3, as it's what upstream
    uses now.
  * Add two new binary packages: liblensfun-bin (with utilities), and
    python3-lensfun (Python 3 module).
    - use the python3 dh addon to handle the python3 packaging
  * Rename the DOCDIR parameter for cmake to CMAKE_INSTALL_DOCDIR, as upstream
    uses GNUInstallDirs.cmake now.
  * Rework the building of the documentation: since BUILD_DOC enables other
    documentation than the API docs, we always need to enable it:
    - move doxygen as proper build dependency
    - always enable BUILD_DOC in cmake
    - add the python3-docutils build dependency, needed for rst2man
  * Use a locally installed mathjax instead of a remote version:
    - point the doxygen configurations to the local path; patch
      local-mathjax.diff
    - add the libjs-mathjax dependency to liblensfun-doc
  * Bump shlibs to >= 0.3.2.
  * Stop passing --buildsystem=cmake to dh, as there is only the CMake
    buildsystem upstream now.
  * Tighten the -data dependency in the library package.
  * Stop installing manual-main.txt in liblensfun-doc, as it's just one source
    of the API docs.
  * Install the documentation examples in liblensfun-dev, making sure to not
    compress them.
  * Backport upstream commit 3f74b78e4ee9f1d400ebbf2b9093a0f9c48c6307 to fix
    the Database unit test without an already installed lensfun; patch
    upstream_Use-database-in-source-directory-while-running-tests.patch.
  * Backport upstream commit 9ec857bb403accc262a9b5a9c2921b5c064fc9c8 to fix
    DESTDIR installation for the python stuff; patch
    upstream_Patch-47-respect-DESTDIR-when-installing-python-stuf.patch
  * Pass -DBUILD_TESTS=ON to cmake to enable the unit tests, now that all of
    them should work.

  * Update watch file (add .gz extension).

  * Add Vcs-* headers.
  * Simplify/improve/sort .install files.
  * Do not build the documentation on arch-only builds:

    - explicitly disable the documentation build (i.e. pass -DBUILD_DOC=OFF
      to cmake) when not producing -doc packages
  * Add the pkg-config build dependency.
  * Bump the priority to optional, since it is used by other "optional"
    sources.
